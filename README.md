# Business-Experimentation
## Consumers' Willingness to Pay for Different Delivery Time Intervals
Team project for Business Experimentation and Causal Methods (BA830)

### Data Source
- Questionnaires

### Project Objectives
- We assume that the more precise the delivery time interval is, the more willingly a customer will place an order. By analyzing the extent of food delivery time interval affecting consumerâ€™s willingness to place an order, we would like to provide evidence to help the delivery platforms gain more profits and consumers have a better user experience.

### Language/Methods
- Language: R
- Questionnaire Design
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Causal Analysis (Regression Analysis)

### Project Summary
-We considered participants' demographic information and provided different food categories options to reduce the bias in the analysis.
- According to the regression analysis, we found that demographic and consumers' preference of food categories influence our willingness-to-pay experiment. For example,
  - People who order from a fast-food restaurant or a pizzeria are more time-sensitive.
  - People who favor ordering Chinese cuisine are slightly more in favor of short delivery time interval estimates.
  - Consumers who had high previous order frequency tended to pay more attention to food delivery time intervals.
